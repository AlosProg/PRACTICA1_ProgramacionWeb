                <p id="id2">Kids are serious business.
                They need toys that are both safe and educational. Toys need to be fun
                and allow children's minds to create beyond any functionality the toy
                has. There is no reason that they cannot be both safe and fun. Children
                need lots of clothes because they grow so fast. And they need sports to
                offset childhood obesity and the illnesses associated with obesity.</p>
